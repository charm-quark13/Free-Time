./Beer-Calculator/
**************************************
Contains the source code to scrape beer varieties and hop varieties from public websites. Data is then published into a csv and collected into an Excel and odt file for easy spreadsheet manipulation. Users can select from a list of popular beer varieties and calculate the expected color of the beer given the quantities and types of malt used to make the mash.

**************************************
./Hockey-Predict/
**************************************
Contains the source code to scrape normal and advanced skater and goalie statistics from hockey-reference.com. Statistics are formatted as uncleaned csv files by season and separated by skaters and goalies. 

Hockey-ds.py is used to clean the data and will be used to apply machine learning and general statistical algorithms to the data sets.
